#Animatable CSS Tooltips

Following on from the pure <a href="https://github.com/AdamWhitcroft/CSS3.Tooltips">CSS3 tooltips</a> I posted a little while ago, I offer up another solution.

These differ from my original post however both in markup and function. The original tooltips made use of the <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> pseudo-elements and while this is probably the most succinct method the major downfall is that CSS animations and transitions can not, at this time, be applied to pseudo-elements.

With only a minor change in the markup, these tooltips are completely animatable.
